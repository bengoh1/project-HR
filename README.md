This repository contains the Capstone for my Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

Salifort Motors is a fictitious company whose HR wants to improve satisfaction levels at the company.  Based on the data collected, they want to have a model that can predict whether or not an employee will leave the company.

In identifying factors that lead to employees leaving, HR hopes to reduce the time and expense of recruiting new employees by increasing employee retention.

The project uses:-

•	Random Forests

•	Extreme Gradient Boosting

to predict employees leaving the company and identify factors that lead to their departure.
